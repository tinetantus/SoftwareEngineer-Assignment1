**Instructions:**
1. Create an ingredients list
2. Create a restaurant that uses ingredients list
3. Use the restaurant to create a menu
4. (Optional) Create Pricing changes through the restaurant

**Simulation of ordering Process**
1. Create a customer depending on their ordering type when they make an entry (take away, delivery, in-restaurant)
2. Customer adds menu items to the order
3. Customer places order (delivery/take away pay instantly)
4. When a customer has paid they leave the unpaid list and the money gets added to the restaurants account

**Assumptions**
1. Only one of each customer type before order (i.e. only one delivery type customer until they have ordered then we can create another)
2. There is a known distance between restaurant and delivery destination
